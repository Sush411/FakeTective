            <h2>What is FakeTective?</h2>
            <p>FakeTective is a cutting-edge, machine-learning-powered tool designed to help consumers identify fake product reviews. Our mission is to ensure transparency and enable users to make informed decisions by distinguishing genuine feedback from deceptive reviews.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How Does FakeTective Work?</h2>
            <p>FakeTective uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze review content. The reviews are processed using a trained machine learning model that predicts whether the review is fake or real based on patterns in the text.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Factors Determine a Fake Review?</h2>
            <p>Our model identifies fake reviews by examining various linguistic and behavioral patterns, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overuse of common phrases:</strong> Fake reviews often rely on generic, repetitive phrases to seem authentic.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Extremely positive or overly negative reviews without much context are flagged as suspicious.</li>
                <li><strong>Length of Reviews:</strong> Very short or excessively long reviews can sometimes indicate manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Unnatural Language Patterns:</strong> Reviews written in a style that doesnâ€™t match typical user behavior are considered questionable.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Features Were Used to Train the Model?</h2>
            <p>FakeTective was trained on a large dataset of labeled reviews (both fake and real) using the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Textual Features:</strong> Word frequency, sentence length, and use of punctuation.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Features:</strong> Polarity and intensity of sentiments expressed in the reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Stylistic Features:</strong> Writing style, use of adjectives, and readability scores.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Patterns:</strong> Timing and frequency of review submissions (if available in the dataset).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why is Detecting Fake Reviews Important?</h2>
            <p>Fake reviews distort the perception of products and services, leading consumers to make uninformed decisions. Businesses may also suffer reputational damage from fake negative reviews. By identifying fake reviews, FakeTective helps maintain a fair and transparent online marketplace.</p>

            <p>We are dedicated to continually improving FakeTective by integrating the latest advancements in machine learning and NLP, ensuring the highest level of accuracy and reliability for our users.</p>
